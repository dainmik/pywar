## 🎮 Requirements

- Card rank (from best to worst):
    - [ ] A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

- [ ] Game uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards.
- [ ] At the start of the game, initialize the deck in a random order.
- [ ] Divide the deck evenly among players. These decks are called ACTIVE decks.

- Battle phase:
    - [ ] All players reveal the top card of their deck.
    - [ ] The player with the highest card wins and moves the won cards to their INACTIVE deck.
        - [ ] Aces are the highest (if Joker is not in play) and suits are ignored.
    - [ ] If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a War.

- War phase
    - [ ] All players place the next card from their ACTIVE deck face down.
    - [ ] And also place one more card from their ACTIVE deck face up.
    - [ ] The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to their INACTIVE deck.
    - [ ] If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.

- [ ] If a player runs out of ACTIVE cards, shuffle the INACTIVE deck, and this deck becomes ACTIVE.
- [ ] If a player runs out of ACTIVE cards, and there are no cards in their INACTIVE deck, they lose.
